		<h4> 2016 - Current | iOS: Swift 3.0 | iOS: Messages Framework | Storyboardless Auto Layout |</h4>
		<div class='textBox'> 
			<p>Emoji Ink Messenger is an iMessages application I am currently developing alongside the artists at Tight Corp(tig.ht). It is a natural progession of their Emoji Ink web and iOS applications. It allows you to combine Emoji images to create expressive stickers for your conversations.</p>
			<p>What you see in the video below is a beta build. The project is built in swift using a loose MVVM design pattern. Its layout was done using a storyboardless design with auto-layout. In the demo you can see me creating and placing stickers using the application. I really enjoyed working under the constraints that an iMessages app forces upon the builder. It was a wonderful challenge to build the viewModel system for this format.</p></br>

		<h4>2016 | iOS: Swift 3.0 | Interface Builder | Node.js | PostgreSQL |</h4>
		<div class='textBox'> 
			<p>CardBoard is a social network app created with the goal of enabling local trades between players of the Magic The Gathering TCG. Essentially, it's an instant-on trade "forum" that is localized around a cluster of users, much like Tinder locality. The primary function of CardBoard is to make seamless connections between users hoping to trade cards regardless of how outgoing they are.</p>
			<p>The project, in its current state, has a functional backend which is capable of serving up high-res images of MTG cards via Amazon Web Services, and REST API calls to my Node.js backend are used to serve user lists and profiles via a PSQL database. It is built using Interface Builder with a primarily MVC design pattern. </p>
			<p>What you see in the video is the list building module of CardBoard, where the user is able to curate lists of MTG cards. Here, the user manipulates and browses their card list, which are hosted remotely in a database. All of the data represented in the demos below is acquired via a network connection and is cached appropriately client-side. As you can see, everything runs quite smoothly. I'm super proud of the current state of this project but, unfortunately, school and work have it shelved for now.</p></br>

		<h4>2014 - 2015 | HTML 5 | JavaScript | p5.js | Web Audio API |</h4>
		<div class='textBox'> 
			<p>One of my first independent projects, wkncViz was a collaboration between my friend Cameren and I between January and April of 2015. During this time, we spent our weekends programming a visualizer that is driven by our college radio's online audio stream and designed to function as a digital art piece at North Carolina State University's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scyQPk6n0xA' target='_blank'>Hunt Library</a>. It was completed as part of the library's inaugural "Code+Art" competition, and can still be seen there today.</p>
			<p>My work on this project involved developing test tools that could analyze the frequency range of the incoming audio stream, and prototypes that used the data generated by those tools to drive objects on screen. I was responsible for most of the code that drives the "bird" objects' patterns, the code used to build the clouds/drive their movement, and a number of odds and ends throughout the application.</p>
			<p>In addition to my programming work, I was responsible for providing a visual direction for our application. Other team members contributed assets such as the buildings, and sidebar to the project.  In retrospect, I am proud of the project but definitely recognize its visual shortcomings, and lack of evolution in its graphics. However, as with most projects, we had a deadline to meet and not all of our ideas could come to fruition.</p></br>

			<div class='textBox'> If you wish to check out a live version of this you can find it <a href='http://pugstreetsoftware.com/harrison/projects/wkncviz/'' target='_blank'>here</a>. <b>Note: </b> For it to work properly, it should be opened in Google chrome on a decent computer. You will have to use <b>"CMD -"</b> to zoom out so you can see the whole thing and you might even need to refresh the page after zooming out to get it to run properly if you're on a macbook, as it's designed strictly for a <b>6816x2240</b> pixel display.</div></br>
